Database Name:Clearence

**Still trying to upload the project**


**API USED**

SMS API --- https://beem.africa/sms-api/

I Use this SMS API to send Reminder to Students to pay for their bills before sitting for there exams. 

**How the System Work**

This is a clearance system it was a final project for my final year for my IT Degree in 2019, the idea to intergrate this system with Beem SMS API came to help Accounts Department to Remind Student to Pay for their Bills which helps alot to send information to individual students rather than displaying on notice Board which for privacy is not good, also it can be used to send Examination Results for Primary and Secondary School for each Parent and im sure it will help alot of parents to get full reports on their kids.

Thank you so much
