**CHALLENGE DETAILS**


Theme: Solving problems for SMESSmall and medium sized enterprises and organizations make up most of the businesses and Beem users across Africa. For example, these organizations can be retail shops, service businesses, agencies, schools, religious institutions. 

The challenge for these organizations is that their customers are increasingly moving online, mobile or digital. Some of them may already have a website or an ecommerce shop or presence on social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp).

These organizations need help to improve their productivity as well as how to communicate and engage better with their customers or sell their products or services more easily on these digital platforms. Your challenge is to develop something that will help these organizations and SMEs. 

**This can either be a standalone app or tool or it can be an integration or plugin for an existing commonly used open source platform.**


**HOW MY PROJECT FIT**


As we know that Technology comes to make communication easy and effective more that it was before.. In Education there are things that needs to be done especially in schools, collages and universities that might help Parents, and Students to get information on time. For Example most of Parents now are Busy with their Jobs which leads to forget to follow up their childrens school performances and it is very bad. But what if Parents get SMS direct from the Schools which shows the performance of their childrens in school..Yes they will be attention everyday and it will help more on parents to know ways to help their children perform well in school etc

**API USED**


SMS API --- https://beem.africa/sms-api/

I Use this SMS API to send Reminder to Students to pay for their bills before sitting for there exams. 


**HOW MY SYSTEM WORKS**

This is a digital clearance system it was a final project for my final year for my IT Degree in 2019, This System Interects between Registar Office, Account Department, Library and Students, where by the main objective was to change from manual clearance system to digital to help student save more time, but also to make sure that accounts dpt , registar office and library to never loose their records.

For the Part that I integrate SMS API is when an Accountants needs to remind All student that did not pay a certain fee to pay before sitting for their exams, and it is very effective rather than putting names on notice boards, and we know that not everyone prefer to visit and read announcements on the boards.

So the Accountant will send a Bulk SMS to all Student and the SMS will be like " Hello John Doe Kindly you are Required to pay Tshs 300,000/= for Tution Fee before Sitting for your Exams. Note that Student who did not pay on time will be disqulified. Thank you"

- This will help a lot of student and parents to be get the right information at the right time

Thank you so much
